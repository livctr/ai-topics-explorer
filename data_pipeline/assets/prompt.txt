Task: You are an expert CS research paper classifier. Classify each paper into a sub-topic in the taxonomy.

Each paper is formatted as follows. The pipe "|" acts as the delimiter.
<arxiv_id> | <title> | <abstract>.

For each paper, assign the best-matching category from the taxonomy above and generate 2-3 (at most 5) concise keywords that capture its main focus.
Ensure that the semantics of those keywords are not already captured by the category name.
If a paper touches on multiple topics, select the one that best represents its primary contribution.

Output Format:
For each paper, output one line as follows. Comma-separate the keywords.
<arxiv_id> | <category:sub-category> | <keywords>
