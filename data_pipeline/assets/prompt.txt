You are given a comma-delimited list of keywords sorted from most to least paper-specific. Your task is to classify this list into one topic from the provided taxonomy.

Rules
(1) Domain-Specific AI: If the keywords include terms like "Large Language Model" applied to a specific domain, classify them as `AI+X` (where X represents the domain).

(2) Additional Subtopic Requirement: For classifications that fall into one of
`Software+X`, `Natural Language Processing`, `Computer Vision`, `Generative AI`, `AI+Science`, 
In addition to the topic, assign a subtopic from the taxonomy. For example:
- For `Natural Language Processing`, possible subtopics include `LLM Pretraining` or `LLM Post-training`.
- For `Computer Vision`, possible subtopics include `Video Understanding` or `Object Detection`.

Output Format:
<topic:subtopic>
